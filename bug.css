The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used carefully.  For example, nesting `calc()` expressions without proper spacing or using unsupported operations can cause parsing errors.  Another issue is the lack of support for certain units within `calc()` across different browsers, causing inconsistencies. Using `calc()` with variables that are not properly defined can also be a problem.
